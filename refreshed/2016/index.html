  <h2>The search</h2>

<p>Having decided to ditch WordPress as the CMS on my site and use a static site generator, I started my search for one. General reading on the web seemed to all point at <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, I did not like the fact that the content format in Jekyll was mostly fixed. I explored many other systems Hexo, Hugo, Pelican, Hyde, Brunch, Middleman, Harp, Expose, …</p>

<p>A couple of them were in PHP as well and thus tempting, but all of them proved to be rather inflexible and not what I was looking for. Then I remembered <a href="https://kushaldas.in/" target="_blank">Kushal Das</a> used something for his blog. I asked him and he pointed out to a script that he used, but more importantly, he mentioned <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/" target="_blank">Lektor</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Lektor...</h2>

<p>What caught my attention was that Lektor was written by the author of Flask, a Python micro-framework which I love.</p>

<p>The installation was super simple, and I had the quickstart running in minutes. What stood out immediately was that Lektor had an admin interface which opened in the browser and second the build system was incremental and ran as soon as I saved anything in the admin.</p>

<p>Lektor is not a fixed format CMS, but it is more of a framework. From the introduction to Lektor - "You can model your own blog posts and render them with the templates you want to use. There is not a single built-in template that you have to use. The only thing it gives you is a quickstart that sets up the folders and copies default minimalistic templates over."</p>

<h2>The transition</h2>
<p>I now wanted something which could import WordPress posts into Lektor. Unable to find any such plugin I hacked my own <a href="https://github.com/tariquesani/lektor-exporter" target="_blank">WordPress to Lektor</a> export plugin. The plugin works pretty well, and I could export 1200 posts from my old blog to Lektor. Unfortunately, it turns out that Lektor does not scale well as of now. So I dropped the idea of converting the whole of the old site to Lektor and started afresh. A new design and a new set of functionality.</p>

<p>As I kept creating templates for this site, I kept incorporating more and more features. The <a href="https://github.com/tariquesani/tariquesani.net" target="_blank">complete code for this website</a> is available on GitHub. The generated content is also tracked in a separate Git repo. As of now I have not actually set up a deployment pipeline but will do in due course. For comments I use Disqus, the search is Google Site Search.</p>

<p>The old content was converted to static files using the Simply Static Wordpress plugin. Before turning WordPress to static pages, I switched to Disqus comments and Google Site Search so that visitors do not loose out on these essential functionalities.</p>

  <h2>Why WordPress? </h2>

<p class="text-left" >
  When I switched to WordPress it was out of necessity, I had been keeping a journal for a few years on Live Journal and with the demise of that platform I needed a place to continue keeping those journal entries online. I also needed a place to write new stuff. This domain at the time was hosting just my photography on an instance of Coppermine Photo Gallery, a project I was leading at that point.
</p>

<p class="text-left" >
  WordPress was still in its infancy, it was immensely hackable. Matt was a struggling hacker, and the software was written in PHP. These were reasons enough to start tinkering with WordPress. Additionally, WordPress allowed import of LiveJournal entries. I quickly put together my own theme. Wrote a few plugin and things were smooth...
</p>

<h2>Why I still code?</h2>

<p class="text-left" >
  Let me digress a bit here. The shortest answer to this would be because I really really love to code. Coding was one of my earliest hobbies. Coding involves several other things I like, a bit of writing, a bit of Math, lot of exploration and problem solving. Since most of what I code is scratching a personal itch and open sourced, there is a sense of satisfaction of having created something useful for myself and possibly someone else. This website, at least, to begin with, was just an extension of my need to code.
</p>

<h2>Why bye bye WordPress?</h2>

<p class="text-left" >
  Well, things were almost smooth but not really. There were updates and then security updates and then plugin updates. The Wordpress core started to become very popular, more powerful and in turn more complex. As it stands, WordPress is the most flexible and feature rich CMS that PHP has to offer.
</p>

<p class="text-left" >
  The complexity meant that the easy hackability of Wordpress got lost. Without being able to tinker with tweaking stuff around the website, things became boring. I mostly stopped writing. However lately keeping WordPress has become expensive.
</p>

<p class="text-left" >
  The popularity has come at a price. Wordpress has become the prime target of script kiddies and crackers from across the world. Every website on the Internet is vulnerable to hackers to some degree; however, having a custom website would mean that a hacker would need to target your site specifically. The difference with a WordPress based website is that the cracker can target millions of websites at once, without knowing or caring who they belong to.
</p>

<p>When you start out you, firmly feel that your Wordpress install is impregnable! You update the core regularly, you keep all the plugins updated and things run. Till the time they don't. The first time my site got hacked I was almost in disbelief. I then realized that one of the plugins which had a vulnerability had not been updated by the author. Hey! They give it away for free, don't they? No sweat! I restored a clean copy and installed a security plugin. The plugin scan was taking too many resources. I switched till I found one which suited me. I noticed that the site was attracting too much traffic. It was quickly proven to be malicious bot traffic. After several months it happened again, this time, I outsourced the cleanup and put the site behind a proxy, the so-called website firewall. I, however, did not like the idea. This was a simple personal site. It should not cost this much money and time and headaches. I started looking at alternatives. First I looked at other CMSes, then at static site generators. Static site generators appealed a lot to the hacker me. What I chose ultimately and why is written in a <a href="/refreshed/2016/8/lektor-lessons-learned/" >separate post</a></p>

<h2>What this does not mean!</h2>

<p class="text-left" >
  This does not mean that I will never use WordPress for any site. I would still continue to use WordPress on all sites which require a dynamic CMS. Sites which need content to be updated by non tech people and most of my client sites which need a CMS...

       <p>The anatomy of numb hands while cycling!</p>

       </figcaption>
       
</figure>

<p>tldr; Long rides will bring it on. With understanding and effort, it can be avoided.</p>

<p>Every rider experiences some amount numbness in hand sometime or the other. This is specially brought on when the rider is tired on a long ride. Recently during a 400km brevet in Nagpur some complained about it and blamed it on bad roads, it needs to be understood that bad roads are just one facet of it.</p>

<h2>Why and what of hand numbness.</h2>

<p>To understand why hand numbness occurs we have to look into what causes numbness. In this case compression of nerve cause the numbness. There are two nerves which can be affected in this case.  The ulnar nerve that runs from the bottom of your wrist and to your pinky and ring finger, or the median nerve that runs from the middle of your wrist on to your thumb, index finger, middle finger and ring finger.</p>

<p>The diagram above clearly illustrates which nerve is pinched in the two most common positions on a drop handle (mistakenly called roadie) bikes. The ulnar nerve is more commonly pinched as hands are more often on the drops or on the hoods compressing the ulnar nerve.</p>

<h2>What can be done to prevent numbness of hands?</h2>

<h3>Hand and wrist positioning:</h3>

<p>See if your wrist and hand are positioned in line with your forearm. If your wrist is bent, it will pinch the nerve, and cause numbness in your hands. If after adjusting your position, you find that you are still unable to get your forearms, wrists and hands flush then it is time to look at your bike fit.</p>

<h3>Bike fit:</h3>

<p>Is there too much pressure on your hands?  Check the angle of your seat with a spirit level. Broadly, your saddle angle should be between 0% to -3%. If it is more than -3% the body tends to slip forward resulting in too much of your body weight being supported by your hands which can cause them to go numb.</p>

<p>Many over enthusiastic riders to become more "aero" set their handle reach to be too far. Correct reach can be determined by asking a friend to watch you spin on a trainer or while riding. When your hands are on the handle hoods, your elbows should be slightly bent, and your arms should be at an almost right angle to your torso.</p>

<p>Another test to determine you are not putting too much pressure on your arms is to see if you can hold the posture you are in while on your hoods without toppling forward or arching your back once you leave your hands. Note: This can make you fall, and should be done with expert assistance and on a trainer.</p>

<p>Having a strong core is also necessary to keep the body balanced on the bike and not put too much pressure on your hands. Remember your hands are for steering your cycle and are not meant to be legs of a tripod.</p>

<h3>Gloves:</h3>

<p>Gloves not only give a better grip on the handle, but well-padded gloves can distribute pressure on the hands and prevent numbness. Ensure that the gloves fit you properly and are neither too tight nor too loose.</p>

<h3>Handlebar Tape and Gels:</h3>

<p>I use to see tapes and gels as a cosmetic accessory, but as my cycling distances grew, I realised that good handlebar tape has been underestimated in the comfort of a ride.</p>

<p>The tapes are designed to reduce the amount of vibration your hands feel when riding, reduced vibrations translate to your hands not getting numb. Not just have comfortably padded handlebars but change them as they wear out.</p>

<h3>Stretching and flexing:</h3>
<p>Lastly, all said and done the best way to get pressure off from the hands is to get your hands off the handle! If you are old like me, ensure that you flex your fingers before and after you put on your gloves. Twirl the wrists till they are supple. Give hands rest while cycling by changing the grip and position on the handlebar as often as needed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it can be said that if you are sensitive towards your body needs, sensible with your riding style and bicycle numb hands can be easily tackled.</p>

<p>Isn't that supposed to feel and be special? Well, it does not. It does not even feel different from last year or before that or one even before before that!</p>

<p>What did I do in last one year that I feel is special for me? I started to cycle. I have never been one to do any sort of consistent physical activity. In the past decade, I have managed to keep up a somewhat healthy routine and mother nature has been kind to me. Doing any sort of "ultra" activity was just not my thing, but I did manage to start cycling. When I had begun, I had aimed to be able to do a 200km brevet before my 50th birthday. I achieved that goal within 90 days. I quickly moved further ahead and completed a 300 km brevet. This encouraged me to upscale my target, and I wanted to attempt being a Super Randonneur, that entails doing 200, 300, 400, and 600 km brevet in a single season. This was not to be for various reasons. One of them being a recent affliction of Sciatica. I will try to do it in the upcoming season. </p>

<h2>What has changed?</h2>

<p>A 30 year old me would have been bitterly disappointed at not becoming a super randonneur, at 50 I say that I will try in my 51<sup>st</sup> year to do that. Perspective on things has changed, I am not in a competition. I realise, I never was in a competition, and no one ever is. It is a journey.  Failures are lessons, no one other than you feels that it is shameful. Now I don't either. Failures are opportunities to refactor. This in turn allows me to truly appreciate and feel happy about the successes of people around me.</p>

<p>A 30 year old me would be disappointed to know that at 50 I still "work" and wish continue to work till I can. A 30 year old me would be incredulous at my saying money rapidly becomes irrelevant to happiness. A 30 year old me would be in disbelief if I admitted to being in a depression and then coming out of it after some hard work. A 30 year old me would be in a panic if I said I still have bitter fights with Swati. It's not so bad, just shows we are still individuals. A 30 year old me would not understand why I am so forgiving and empathic.</p>

<p>A 30 year old me would be proud of me as a husband, a parent and proud of my son. A 30 year old me would happy that all my plans succeeded, yes those dreams were in fact plans.</p>

<p>Things don't change overnight, it takes some effort to take a bird's eye view of your own life to get a perspective. In many ways, I am still trying, in many ways I have surpassed my own expectations. At 50 I can afford not to speculate on what will be.</p>

<p>At 50 I can say, What will be will be...</p>

  <p>Today Aasim started his studies at <a href="http://drexel.edu/" target="_blank">Drexel University</a>, Philadelphia, PA, USA. He will be pursuing an undergraduate degree in Entrepreneurship and Innovation with hopefully some minors in Computer Science and Renewable Energy.</p>

<p>It is a new beginning for Aasim. I cannot say that this has been in making for as long as I can remember, rather, Aasim has reached here by a series of coincidences and mishaps. That is apart from the hard work he has put in to get admission and scholarships to study at Drexel.</p>

<p>Aasim hopped several schools while in Nagpur. He started schooling at Sandipani and we were pretty sure he would be studying there till his 12th grade. Going to a foreign land was not even remotely considered. Unfortunately, the very dynamic founder of Sandipani school died in a car crash When Aasim was in 3rd grade. The school continued but gradually a few things started happening which we did not like. Talking to teachers was not helpful. The final straw was when he was labeled as not interested in studies added to it was the continuation of state board system by the school.</p>

<p>About the same time, Jain International School, reputed to be one of the best in the country opened up a branch in Nagpur. We went there, The campus was impressive. Teachers were friendly. Aasim aced his entrance test.  We shifted him there. Things were great for about one and a half year when we got a panicked phone from another parent saying things at school were real messy and that the parent Jain International school body was withdrawing their name and support from the institution due to nonpayment of their dues. This was not only shocking but very disgusting for us that the management was playing with the education of so many children while keeping everyone in the dark.</p>

<p>Mid 5th grade Aasim shifted to International School of Scholars. The school was new, but the main attraction for us was it had IGCSE curriculum and for Aasim it was that during the summer a group of students was visiting NASA for a study tour. For next three years we were relaxed, however by the time Aasim was in 9th-grade chinks were appearing in the system. There were no teachers for some subjects. Some were not qualified to teach IGCSE students. However, with the help and great efforts from the headmistress to keep things in order Aasim aced his IGCSE, and the school advised all the students to seek admissions elsewhere if they could.</p>

<p>Since Nagpur was no longer an option. Swati started searching for schools across the country. We visited the top ones - did not like them or the culture prevalent. Then Swati stumbled across <a href="http://uwcmahindracollege.org/" target="_blank">United World College, Mahendra College</a> (MUWCI). Everything seemed perfect. One visit to campus and Aasim declared this is where he will do his 11th and 12th. He worked real hard to get admission and got it!</p>

<p>When he was in Nagpur Aasim was interested in Physics. The first year in MUWCI saw him shift to Economics, then to Renewable Energy and finally he decided he wants to do a business degree with some tech minors. MUWCI gave him an understanding of self and a world view which we could never provide. He had his ups and downs there. The college selection process was aided by the very capable teachers. He shortlisted 10, applied for 7, got in 4 and after a bit of vexation chose Drexel...</p>
